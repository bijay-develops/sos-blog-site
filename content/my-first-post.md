 # God - The Son Jesus Christ

We affirm the divinity of Jesus Christ, coequal with the Father and the Holy Spirit (John 10:30; 14:9). He, as the God-man, surrendered only divine prerogatives in the Incarnation, representing both humanity and deity (Phil. 2:5–8; Col. 2:9). Jesus was virgin-born, God incarnate, revealing, redeeming, and ruling over God's kingdom (Is. 7:14; John 1:1, 14; Ps. 2:7–9; Phil. 2:9–11).
Through His sacrificial death, voluntary and substitutionary, Jesus accomplished redemption (John 10:15; Rom. 3:24, 25; 5:8; 1 Pet. 2:24). Believers are justified by His resurrection, securing eternal life and adoption into God's family (Rom. 3:25; 5:8, 9; 1 Cor. 15:20, 23).
Jesus, now ascended, mediates as Advocate and High Priest (Matt. 28:6; Rom. 8:34; Heb. 7:25; 9:24). His resurrection confirms deity, assures believers' future resurrection (John 5:26–29; 14:19; 1 Cor. 15:20, 23), and heralds His return for the Church and the establishment of His millennial kingdom (Acts 1:9–11; 1 Thess. 4:13–18; Rev. 20).
As the final judge, Jesus will judge believers' works, the living at His return, and the unbelieving dead at the Great White Throne (1 Cor. 3:10–15; Matt. 25:31–46; Rev. 20:11–15). As the mediator, head of the Church, and universal King, He holds the ultimate authority (1 Tim. 2:5; Eph. 1:22; 5:23; Col. 1:18; Is. 9:6, 7; Acts 17:30, 31).
